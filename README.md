# SoloReacts
SoloReacts is a semester-long project to strengthen React fundamentals by building three websites: a one-week birthday gift site that emails a $50 restaurant card, a Campus Connect landing page to link students with events and resources, and a personal portfolio showcasing academic and professional work.
